# Career Guidance Recommendation

This is a career guidance recommendation designed to help 12th-grade students explore various career options based on their academic performance, interests, goals, and preferred study methods. The project provides recommendations for relevant fields of study, suggested courses, and resources (both online and offline) for different academic levels.

- **Dynamic Suggestions**: The bot provides custom suggestions based on grades, career goals, and field of interest, guiding students towards a suitable academic path.
- **Online/Offline Resources**: Links to online courses and book recommendations for students who prefer classroom or self-study methods.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Backend logic is developed using Python.
- **Flask**: Web framework used to manage routes and render templates.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend built using HTML for structure and CSS for styling.
